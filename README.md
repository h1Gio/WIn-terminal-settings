# Win-terminal-settings
My windows terminal settings.json file

The emojis file contains a lot of emojis by Discord's holiday event. Please change the icon path becuase it has my username, you will need to change the path for example "C:\Users\PUT_USER_NAME_HERE\Desktop\PUT_ICON_AND_ICON_EXTENSION_HERE" if your pc's name is john and the image file for the icon is skull.png then the path for the icon will look like this, "C:\Users\john\Desktop\skull.png"

!DO NOT REPLACE ALL OF YOUR SETTINGS WITH MINE SOME FILES AND NAMES WILL NOT BE THE SAME.! 
!PLEASE CHECK THE PATHS!
